        <h2>Mayday parade </h2>

            A Lesson in Romantics. After signing to Fearless in 2006, the band also signed 
            onto a major label with Atlantic in 2009. Their second studio album, Anywhere 
            but Here was released in October 2009[1] and their third album, entitled Mayday

            <h1>MCR</h1>
            <p>My Chemical Romance (commonly abbreviated to MCR or My Chem) is an American 
                rock band from Newark, New Jersey. The band's current lineup consists of lead 
                vocalist Gerard Way, lead guitarist Ray Toro, rhythm guitarist Frank Iero, and 
                bassist Mikey Way. They are considered one of the most influential rock groups 
                of the 2000s and a major act in the pop punk and emo genres, despite the band 
                rejecting the latter label.[1]

                Founded on September 12, 2001, by Gerard, Mikey, Toro, and drummer Matt 
                Pelissier (and later joined by Iero), the band signed with Eyeball Records 
                and released their debut album, I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your 
                Love, in 2002. They signed with Reprise Records the next year and released 
                their major-label debut, Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge, in 2004. Shortly 
                after the album's release, Pelissier was replaced by Bob Bryar. The album was 
                a commercial success, attaining platinum status over a year later.
                
                The success of the band's previous albums was eclipsed by that of their 2006 
                rock opera concept album, The Black Parade, which was a major commercial 
                success, with lead single "Welcome to the Black Parade" topping the UK singles 
                chart. The album solidified the band's following, despite negative coverage in 
                the Daily Mail generating controversy. The band's fourth studio album, Danger 
                Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys, was released in 2010. Bryar 
                departed the band prior to the release of the album, and in 2012, they added 
                touring keyboardist James Dewees. In 2012 and 2013, the band released a series 
                of singles they had recorded in 2009 under the collective title Conventional 
                Weapons. My Chemical Romance announced its breakup on March 22, 2013.[2] In 
                2014, a greatest hits album titled May Death Never Stop You was released[3] 
                and a tenth-anniversary reissue of The Black Parade was released in 2016.
                
                On October 31, 2019, the band announced a reunion show, which took place in Los Angeles on December 20, 2019.[4] In January 2020, they announced additional shows and a Reunion Tour, which commenced in 2022 after a two-year postponement due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

            <h2>BMTH</h2>
            <p>Bring Me the Horizon (often abbreviated as BMTH) are a British rock band, 
                formed in Sheffield in 2004. The group currently consists of lead vocalist 
                Oliver Sykes, guitarist Lee Malia, bassist Matt Kean, drummer Matt Nicholls 
                and keyboardist Jordan Fish. They are signed to RCA Records globally and 
                Columbia Records exclusively in the United States.
                The band released their debut album Count Your Blessings in 2006. Upon 
                release, the album's deathcore sound polarised listeners, and was largely 
                met with critical disdain. The band began to break away from this sound with 
                their second album Suicide Season (2008), which was considered a creative, 
                critical and commercial turning point for the band. Bring Me the Horizon 
                released their third album, There Is a Hell Believe Me I've Seen It. There 
                Is a Heaven Let's Keep It a Secret., in 2010, propelling them to greater 
                international fame, whilst incorporating influences from classical music,
                 electronica and pop. Their major label debut, Sempiternal, (2013) achieved 
                 Gold certification in Australia (35,000) and Silver in the United Kingdom 
                 (60,000). That's the Spirit (2015) debuted at number two in the UK Albums 
                 Chart and the US Billboard 200.[1][2] Their sixth studio album Amo (2019) 
                 became their first UK chart-topper. The same year, the band also put out the 
                 commercial release, Music to Listen To... (2019). The following year, the 
                 band released Post Human: Survival Horror (2020), the first in a planned 
                 series of four projects under the Post Human name. The band have also 
                 released two extended plays and two live albums. They have received four 
                 Kerrang! Awards, including two for Best British Band and one for Best Live 
                 Band, and have been nominated for two Grammy Awards. The band has sold over 
                 4 million records worldwide, and have topped the UK Rock & Metal Singles 
                 Chart with songs such as "Throne", "Drown, "Mantra" and "Parasite Eve".[3]
                
                The style of their early work, including their debut album Count Your 
                Blessings, has been described primarily as deathcore, but over the course 
                of several albums, the band has shifted its style and moved in a more 
                melodically-oriented direction by combining their approach to metalcore 
                with elements of electronica, pop and hip hop.[4][5]</p>
